;;; Commentary:

;; This is an ugly hack to get something resembling the pandoric-eval
;; macro from Let Over Lambda.

;; https://letoverlambda.com/textmode.cl/guest/chap6.html

;; The function-like macro eval-here behaves like eval, except that lexical,
;; cl-symbol-macrolet, and cl-macrolet bindings will be available
;; to use within the evaluated form.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl)
;; Used for gv-ref and gv-deref.
(require 'gv)
;; Used for seq-contains.
;(require 'seq)

;; Kludge to ensure that autoload macros are loaded before we
;; start advising them.
